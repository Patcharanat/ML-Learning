## Introduction
- Neural Network consist of notes and connections between nodes
- weight or estimated parameters first are unknown to a neural network model, but when we fitted the specific dataset to the model, it's calculated for us.
- curved lines, "**Activation Functions**" are shaped into final graph that can fit the data, and there're many common curved lines we can choose for the neural network, such as "**soft plus**", "**ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit)", and "**sigmoid**".

# IBM Note

- ML vs DL
    - Human Intervention
        - Classical Machine Learning dependent on human intervention to learn determining a hierarchy of features
        - Deep Learning does not necessarily required human intervention
    - More than 3 layers of Neural Network considered as Deep Learning
    - Feed-Forward
